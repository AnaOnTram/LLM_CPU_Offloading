The equations provided above show how to use the learning curve to predict the time and cost of a specific quantity of units assuming that we know the learning rate. On the other hand, a 50% learning curve would indicate that no additional time or cost would be required for additional units beyond the first unit, since the cumulative average time, (in Wright's model) or the incremental unit time (in Crawford's model) would decrease by 50% each time output doubled."},{"link":"https://whatfix.com/blog/learning-curve/","title":"Learning Curve Theory: Types, Formula, Examples (2025) - Whatfix","snippet":"Learning curve theory provides a formula to calculate and measure improvement in task completion or skill over time.

For example, a 90% learning curve means that for every time the cumulative quantity is doubled, there is a 10% efficiency gain in the cumulative average production time per unit. The percentage states the percentage of time that will carry over to future iterations of the task when production is doubled.  \nLearning Curve Formula\nThe learning curve has a formula to identify a target cumulative average time per unit or batch:  \nY\n=\na\nXb  \nwhere:  \nY\n=\nCumulativeaveragetimeperunitorbatch  \na\n=\nTimetakentoproduceinitialquantity  \nX\n=\nThecumulativeunitsofproductionorthe  \ncumulativenumberofbatches  \nb\n=\nTheslopeorlearningcurveindex,calculated  \nasthelogofthelearningcurvepercentage  \ndividedbythelogof2"],"metadata":[{"start_index":2820,"language":"en-US","embedding_config":"{'engine': '', 'model': 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'}","description":"You can use this Learning Curve Calculator to compute the amount of time required to produce the Nth unit by providing the amount of time required for the first unit and the learning rate r","source":"https://mathcracker.com/learning-curve-calculator","title":"\r\n            Learning Curve Calculator - MathCracker.com\r\n        "},{"language":"en-US","start_index":1826,"title":"\r\n            Learning Curve Calculator - MathCracker.com\r\n        ","embedding_config":"{'engine': '', 'model': 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'}","description":"You can use this Learning Curve Calculator to compute the amount of time required to produce the Nth unit by providing the amount of time required for the first unit and the learning rate r","source":"https://mathcracker.com/learning-curve-calculator"},{"description":"A learning curve graphically depicts how a process improves through learning and increased proficiency.
